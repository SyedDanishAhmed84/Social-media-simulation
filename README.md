📢 Social Media Simulation with Python (OOP Concepts)
This is a simple Python project that simulates the basic features of a social media platform using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like Encapsulation, Classes, Objects, and Methods.

🚀 Features
Create users with private passwords (Encapsulation)

Users can create posts

Posts can receive likes and comments

Notifications are sent when:

- A new post is created

- A post receives a new like

- A post receives a new comment

🛠️ Technologies

📚 Concepts Practiced
Class and Object Creation

Encapsulation (__password attribute)

Method Definitions

Object Interactions

Simple Notification System

🔥 How It Works
Create User objects with name, email, and password.

Users create Post objects with text content.

Posts can be liked or commented on.

Notifications are triggered automatically based on user actions.

📦 Future Improvements
- Allow multiple users to like and comment on posts

- Track which users liked or commented

- Add timestamps to posts and comments

- Build a simple UI with Tkinter or Flask
